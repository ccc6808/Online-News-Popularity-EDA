# Online-News-Popularity-EDA

### Introduction & Motivation

Online news media has flourished in this decade and is gradually replacing traditional newspapers. Understanding what kind of articles will draw audiencesâ€™ attention has been the focus of online news outlets. These media companies have been relying on social media analytics to increase website traffic and gain more readers. Through our analysis, we aim to understand what drives people to click on articles and further provide insights which can benefit authors, online news media, advertising companies, etc.

### Project Proposal
Our goal is to predict the popularity of online news published by Masheable. We will use Python on a challenging dataset to compute various visualizations to identify what characteristics of online news will lead to a higher number of shares in the social networks. We will also build a machine learning model to predict whether an article is popular or not and display which features are most important for a popular article.
